# Reddit-Impersonator
##### by Jack Nash
A bot trained using a recurrent neural network to impersonate Reddit users(specifically /r/Cornell users)

## About
A bot that is meant to impersonate users of the subreddit `/r/Cornell`. It uses a finetuned model of OpenAI's GPT-2 to generate comments based on the text of a post. For right now, the identity of this bot will remain anonymous as I'm curious how people will interact with it without knowing it's not a human. 

Very much a work in progress right now!
